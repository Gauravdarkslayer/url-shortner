## In order to run the project follow these steps:

## Just clone the repo

## Backend

### 1. API part/Backend is included in api folder, navigate to that folder and run npm install, so that it will install all necessary dependencies required for that project

### 2. Add your DB credentials inside config/db.json. I have used mongodb so enter accordingly.

### 3. Now run the project using `node app.js` . You should see a message on your console `Server listening on port <PORT you specified>`. And `Successfully connected to mongodb` if the credentials are correct.


## Frontend
### 1. Frontend is created in React. So just run `npm install` inside frontend folder. And run the project using `npm start`.
